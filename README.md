# Projectile Motion Simulator V1

A simple projectile motion visualizer built with Python and PyQt5.  
Adjust speed, angle, and gravity to simulate different trajectories in real time.

## Features
- Adjustable speed (px/s)
- Adjustable bounce restitution (0-1)
- Adjustable angle (degrees)
- Gravity presets: Earth, Moon, Mars
- Real-time projectile motion
- Visual trajectory path
- Realistic bounce

## Controls
- **Fire** — start simulation  
- **Pause** — stop updating motion  
- **Reset** — reset position and clear trajectory

My first real highschool project on python, i made it to learn GUI creation, practice physics and learn git.

## Running
```bash
pip install PyQt5
python main.py
