# Projectile Motion Simulator v1

A real-time projectile motion visualizer built with **Python** and **PyQt5**.  
This project allows users to adjust launch parameters and observe realistic projectile trajectories with gravity and bouncing.

This is my **first fully self-made Python GUI project**, created to practice:
- GUI development with PyQt5  
- Basic physics simulation  
- Structuring multi-file projects  
- Using Git and GitHub  

---

## Features

- Adjustable launch speed (px/s)
- Adjustable launch angle (degrees)
- Adjustable wall/bounce restitution (0–1)
- Gravity presets:
  - Earth
  - Moon
  - Mars
- Real-time projectile motion
- Visual trajectory path
- Realistic bouncing
- Interactive projectile positioning (drag & hover)

## Controls

- **Fire** — Start the simulation  
- **Pause** — Pause the motion  
- **Reset** — Reset position and clear trajectory

## Running the Project

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyQt5

### Install & Run
```bash
pip install PyQt5
python main.py
