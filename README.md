# Projectile Motion Simulator 

A small **real-time projectile motion visualizer** built with **Python** and **PyQt5**.

I made this project to experiment with basic physics, learn PyQt5, and get more comfortable building and structuring a GUI application from scratch. You can tweak launch parameters and watch the projectile move, bounce, and leave a trajectory in real time.

## Features
- Adjustable launch speed and angle  
- Gravity presets (Earth, Moon, Mars)  
- Real-time trajectory visualization  
- Wall collisions with configurable bounce  
- Drag-and-drop projectile positioning  

---

## Controls
- **Fire** — start the simulation  
- **Pause** — pause the motion  
- **Reset** — reset position and clear trajectory  

---

## Run
```bash
pip install PyQt5
python main.py
